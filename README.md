# Professional README Generator

This project aims to use NodeJS to create a Professional README from user input. I learned how to input badges into my README and link the badge to the correct license link. I also learned how to write to a file using the imported fs module

## Credits

Followed the static badges website from shield.io to implement badges - https://shields.io/badges

Followed the list of the licenses from choosealicense to add it to the available list that the user can choose from - https://choosealicense.com/licenses/

Had trouble implenting the license badge on the README and followed a github tutorial on how to properly format the badge - https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba
